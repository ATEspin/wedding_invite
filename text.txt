Getting drunk on a Sonoma Valley wine tour, California, 2021. 

No trip is complete without Carcassonne. Allison’s go-to strategy: sneaky farmers. Abel’s go-to strategy: random.

Neurohike conference in Kananaskis, Alberta, 2014. This is where we met – eating s’mores and talking about neuroscience. 

Climbing in Yosemite, California, 2019. Everything about this park was stunning. And hot. Our shoes started melting on the rocks. 

Climbing at Grassi Lakes, Alberta, 2019. Canmore is very special for us – it is our dream to live there one day.

Mount Edith Cavell, Alberta, 2018. Although we aren’t great skiers, a backcountry cross country ski trip in -30ºC seemed like a great idea. 

Burstall Pass, Alberta, 2021. Vallies, a summit, golden larches, lakes, dark chocolate… what’s not to love?

Backcountry hike to Skoki Mountain, Alberta, 2015. Just before we started dating. We look happy because we didn’t know that there was 7 hours of walking through a swamp in the rain and snow ahead of us.

Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, 2021. Having fun around California after a year and a half of being apart thanks to Covid. We proposed to each other on this visit in Abel’s apartment :)

City hiking in San Francisco, 2019. 360 view of the city while exploring the MANY hills of SF.

Backcountry hike to Mount Assiniboine, British Columbia, 2016. Hiking over 30km in one day almost killed us, but it was worth it!
